  <h3>INGRIDIENTS</h3>
  <UL>
    <li>225g (1 cup) caster sugar</li>
    <li>300g (2 cups) plain flour (sifted)</li>
    <li>1tsp vanilla extract </li>
    <li>200g (1 cup) of butter melted</li>
    <li>1tsp of baking powder</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    <li>100g-200g chocolate or chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
  </UL>
  <br>
  <h3>STEPS</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Add the sugar and melted butter in a bowl and mix together - a wooden spoon is fine, no need for a whisk.</li>
    <li>Sift the flour, baking powder, vanilla and salt together and add to the sugar and butter mixture. 
        Add the chocolate chips at this stage if you're making chocolate chip cookies.</li>
    <li>Mix together using your hand. Once you get a dough texture, add the egg and knead using your hand again</li>
    <li>Spread some butter onto a baking tray. Take some of the dough, roll into ball then flatten a little. Keep them on the small side as they spread out during baking.
         Also, don't keep biscuits close to each other otherwise they will get stuck together.</li>
    <li>Place in the oven and bake at 160C, gas 3 for 10-20 mins. The bigger the cookies, the longer they'll take to cook. 
        They're ready when the edges are a bit golden.</li>
  </ol>
